# 🌙 SleepPunisher [Fabric]
Did you ever feel like sleeping to skip the hard nights was too easy?

With this mod you'll be able to 'punish' players that want to take the easy way out.

## Features
🍎 Hunger: Wake up with the hunger bar empty. Better eat fast!

🔪 Damage: Wake up confused, with a bunch of bruises and half your health. What just happened?!

💀 Death: Your worse nightmare, you passed away while you slept.

## Usage
Just add the mod to your minecraft instance. After a player sleeps, there is a chance they get punished.

## Configuration
The mod adds a sleep_punisher.json file to the configs folder.
There you will be able to edit the probability of each punishment to happen.

## Future Ideas
Ideally I would like the user to be able to create custom punishments instead of just having them being hardcoded.
If you have any ideas, please do let me know!
